Question 1: Is this approximation accurate? What is a way to improve this approximation?
This approximation is accurate to the size of the timestep. The smaller the time step, the more accurate the approximation.
This is just euler integration and the approximation can be improved if you implement trapezoidal integration.

Question2: Given the curvature k and the maximum wheelspeed dphi_max, what is the maximum robotVel that you can drive your robot at?
Max robot velocity is determined by the outer turning wheel being driven at maximum wheel velocity. 
dPhi_Max = V*(1+bk)
V being robot velocity, k being curvature, and b being the the length from the midpoint to one wheel

Task5:
You would not expect ideal path trajectory in the real world due to real world issues like slip or friction. 
The slip is adding 10% of the velocity to the robot velocity which causes overshoot
Subtracting the slip would cause undershoot. 
Other affects that influence tracking are motor discrepancies, voltage fluctuations, friction, and surface friction(slip)
